# My Tag Data

I use [Wireless Tags](https://wirelesstag.net) to keep track of the temperature of parts of the house, walkin coolers, greenhouses, etc. And my internet connection is somewhat unreliable. There have been more than a few times when I needed to monitor temperature but my internet connection was down.

## Synopsis

    $ docker-compose up

Then set up "URL calling" from the tag manager to your IP address (see https://tfoel.medium.com/monitoring-temperature-other-parameters-with-wireless-sensor-tags-influxdb-and-grafana-451a97e38945).
